# Turing-Machine-Emulator
This is a simple Turing Machine Emulator written in Python.

You can read all about Turing Machines here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine)

## About
This is a fully (I hope!) functional 5 tuple Turing Machine Emulator written in Python. It uses no external libraries and is cross-platform.

The emulator is based on the one found here: [https://morphett.info/turing/turing.html](https://morphett.info/turing/turing.html)

I've included one sample program also taken from the website above. There are more programs on the website which should work with this emulator as well. Note, the included program has one line switched around from the original - wildcard characters have to come last in each set of state instructions.

## How to Use
Download and run turing_machine.py. It will parse the program found in the file, print the instructions, and wait for the user to press ENTER. It will display the starting tape state, and the ending tape state.
